## Usage

### Usage Steps

#### Installing

1. Download the latest release to minimize your own risk, or clone/download repository if you are adventurous. 
2. Install Java (JRE, JDK, or OpenJDK).
3. If you would like to compile the jar yourself, download sbt and run `sbt assembly` within the repository/source folder.

#### Configurations

1. Modify the settings in the `guapswap_config.json` file
2. Change the `apiUrl` to `http://127.0.0.1:9053/` if you are running your own node. This will run GuapSwap CLI in ronin mode.
3. Add your PK to the `userAddress` field.
4. Increase the `swapIntervalInHours` field if you want to increase the time between swaps when running GuapSwap CLI in automatic mode.
5. Inser a valid ErgoDex asset ticker, from the list of available tickers below, into the `swapAssetTicker` field.
6. If you so choose, feel free to modify the dex settings at your own risk.
7. Run `java -jar guapswap-1.1.0-beta.jar --help` to get command usage directions. Use the `--help` flag after any command to get usage directions.

#### GuapSwap CLI Command Usage

1. Run `java -jar guapswap-1.1.0-beta.jar --help` to get command usage directions. Use the `--help` flag after any command to get usage directions.

##### Generate Proxy Address

1. Run `java -jar guapswap-1.1.0-beta.jar generate` to generate a proxy address.
2. Use the generated proxy address instead of your PK to receive your mining payout rewards.

##### Onetime Swap

1. Run `java -jar guapswap-1.1.0-beta.jar swap --onetime <proxy_address>` to make a onetime swap with the given proxy address.

##### Automatic Swap

1. Run `java -jar guapswap-1.1.0-beta.jar swap <proxy_address>` to run GuapSwap CLI in automatic mode. The swaps will occur according to the `swapIntervalInHours` set in the `guapswap_config.json` file.

##### Refund

1. Run `java -jar guapswap-1.1.0-beta.jar refund <proxy_address>` to return all funds locked at the given proxy address to your PK wallet.

##### List

1. Run `java -jar guapswap-1.1.0-beta.jar list <proxy_address>` to list all eUTXO boxes at the given proxy address.

### Usage WARNING

Please have at least 0.1 ERG at the proxy address before deciding to initiate a swap, otherwise you will need to fund it with more ERG. This is to ensure that there are enough funds to pay for the protocol fee and all of the dex fees. The value may also need to be higher depending on the token to be swapped, since some assets require a higher minimum amount of ERG to swap for them.

### Available Commands

1. `generate`
2. `swap [--onetime] <proxy_address>`
3. `refund <proxy_address>`
4. `list <proxy_address>`

### Available Swap Token Tickers
